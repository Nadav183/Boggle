This game was made as a final excercise in Intro to CS course by Nadav Porat and Amir Harel.

The game shows the player a randomized table of letters and the play then tries to build as many words as he can using adjacent letters in the table.

The player can customize the length of the game and the length of the counter at the start of the game.

The game was built exclusively in python using the Tkinter GUI module
