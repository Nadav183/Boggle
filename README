The special functions we added are options at the top of the game, where the
player can change the length of the game if he wants.
In addition we added memes that give appropriate reactions to guessed words
Also, we gave the player the option to regret choosing a letter, and he can
undo the choice.
Also at the beginning of the game there is a countdown to let the user prepare
his bearings before the game begins
